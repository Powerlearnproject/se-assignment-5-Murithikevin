9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Setting Up and Starting Debugging in VS Code
Install VS Code:

Download and install VS Code from the official website.
Install Required Extensions:

Depending on the programming language you are using, install the appropriate extension. For example, for Python, install the "Python" extension; for JavaScript/Node.js, the "JavaScript (ES6) code snippets" extension is useful.
To install an extension, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X, then search for and install the desired extension.
Open or Create Your Project:

Open your project folder in VS Code by going to File > Open Folder and selecting your project directory.
Configure the Debugger:

Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or press Ctrl+Shift+D).
Click on the "create a launch.json file" link to customize the configuration for your project.
Select the environment (e.g., Python, Node.js) and VS Code will generate a launch.json file in the .vscode folder with default settings.
Customize the launch.json file if necessary to specify entry points, environment variables, or any other configurations required for debugging.
Set Breakpoints:

Open the file you want to debug.
Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set a breakpoint on the desired line.
Start Debugging:

With your breakpoints set, click the green play button (Start Debugging) at the top of the Run and Debug view, or press F5.
The debugger will start, and the program will run until it hits the first breakpoint.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints: Allows you to pause the execution of your code at a specific line to inspect the state of your program.
Step Over, Step Into, Step Out: These controls let you navigate through your code one line at a time, delve into functions, or return to the calling function.
Variable Inspection: Hover over variables to see their current values. Use the Variables pane in the Debug view to inspect and modify variables.
Watch Expressions: Add expressions to the Watch pane to monitor their values as you step through the code.
Call Stack: View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program.
Debug Console: Execute code snippets in the context of the current debugging session. Useful for evaluating expressions or testing potential fixes.
Logpoints: Instead of pausing execution, logpoints print messages to the console when a specific line is reached.
Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met, helping to narrow down issues more efficiently.
Exception Handling: Configure the debugger to break on handled or unhandled exceptions, allowing you to catch errors as they occur.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
